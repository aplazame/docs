# Checkout process
This tutorial will guide you through the integration of Aplazame as a payment method for your online store using a REST or JSON API and JavaScript, or native SDKs for mobile platforms.

If you have an e-commerce platform, you can consult the specific documentation on [integration for modules](https://aplazame.com/integraciones/).

:::caution
Before starting integration with our payment method, we recommend that you go to our section on [first steps](https://ayuda.aplazame.com/hc/es-es/articles/360014854679--C%C3%B3mo-me-creo-una-cuenta-como-tienda-en-Aplazame-) to complete the registration process and obtain your credentials.
