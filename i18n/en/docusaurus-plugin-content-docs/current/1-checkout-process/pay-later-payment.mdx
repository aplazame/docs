# Pay in 15 days
This section describes the entire checkout process in case you want to integrate the module 'Pay in 15 days'. This is divided into five steps: creation, start, confirmation, result and capture of the shipment. From here, you will jump to the different sections where the operation is described in detail.

## Checkout process
![checkout-flow](/img/checkout-paylater-integration-flow-en.svg)

### 1. Checkout creation
Once the buyer has selected Aplazame as the payment method for your online store, you need set up a call to your server that allows the creation of a new checkout to begin using Aplazame’s REST API.

[See the technical description of how to create a checkout](../../checkout-creation/)

:::info
We offer you the possibility of integrating our payment button with Aplazame, which enables or disables the payment method automatically based on the [limits configured in your account](https://ayuda.aplazame.com/hc/es-es/articles/360014973600--C%C3%B3mo-configurar-el-widget-de-Aplazame-en-tu-tienda-).
:::

* [JavaScript SDK](../../sdk-javascript/#check-availability-pay-15-days)
* [iOS™ SDK](../../sdk-ios/#check-availability-pay-15-days)
* [Android™ SDK](../../sdk-android/#check-availability-pay-15-days)

### 2. Initiating the checkout

### 3. Order confirmation
Once the buyer has completed the payment process satisfactorily, Aplazame will confirm the result with your store.

[See the technical description of how to confirm an order](../../checkout-confirmation/)

### 4. Result of the request
Once the payment process has been completed, Aplazame will show the result of the financing request to the buyer.

:::info
If you like, you can configure return functions for different process events:
:::

* [JavaScript](../../sdk-javascript/#checkout-result)
* [iOS™ SDK](../../sdk-ios/#checkout-result)
* [Android™ SDK](../../sdk-android/#checkout-result)


### 5. Capture of the order
Finally, there would be a step to complete the process. It is necessary to confirm the shipment of the purchase because since that moment, the countdown for the payment starts.

[See the technical description of how to create a capture](../../checkout-capture/)
