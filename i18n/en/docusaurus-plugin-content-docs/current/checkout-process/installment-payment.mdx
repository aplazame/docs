# Installment payment
This section describes the entire checkout process in case you want to integrate the 'Installment payment' module. This is divided into four steps: creation, start, confirmation and result. From here, you will jump to the different sections where each operation is described in detail.

## Checkout process

### 1. Checkout creation
Once the buyer has selected Aplazame as the payment method for your online store, you need set up a call to your server that allows the creation of a new checkout to begin using Aplazame’s REST API.


[See the technical description of how to create a checkout](../checkout-creation/)

:::info
We offer you the possibility of integrating our payment button with Aplazame, which enables or disables the payment method automatically based on the [limits configured in your account](https://ayuda.aplazame.com/hc/es-es/articles/360014973600--C%C3%B3mo-configurar-el-widget-de-Aplazame-en-tu-tienda-)
:::

* [iOS™ SDK](../sdk-ios/check-availability)
* [Android™ SDK](../sdk-android/check-availability)

### 2. Initiating the checkout
