# Additional settings in Magento 2.x
Here you will find everything related to the additional configuration of our Aplazame plugin for Magento version 2 and later.

## Payment method and orders
Settings for the payment button/selector and the orders with Aplazame.

Field | Description
----- | -----------
Title | Text for the title to display next to the payment button.
Aplazame Button CSS Selector | CSS selector to show/hide the Aplazame payment method.
Automatic invoice generation | Create an invoice each time an order is paid with Aplazame.
Use 'order' ID on Aplazame | Each time an order is confirmed, the order ID will be used instead of the cart ID (`quote`) using the `order_` prefix to avoid DB problems with duplicate numeric IDs.

## Widget
Settings for the widget (both the [standard widget](../../../api/widget/installment-payment#simulation) and the [v4 widget](../../../api/widget/widget-v4)).

Field | Description
----- | -----------
Default instalments | Allows you to configure the number of instalments that the widget will display by default.
Force pay in 4 widget | This field causes a complete change in the rendering of the wdiget in case the merchant supports the product **Pay in 4**.

Widget if Aplazame is not available | Allows you to show an alternative widget if the product/cart total does not meet the requirements to display the widget.
:::tip
  You can edit the style of the **standard widget** from the [control panel](https://vendors.aplazame.com/) in the section **Preferencias > Ajustes del widget** but keep in mind that, in the common settings with those of the plugin, those of the latter take priority.
