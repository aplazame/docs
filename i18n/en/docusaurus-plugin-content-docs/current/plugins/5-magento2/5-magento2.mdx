# Plugin for Magento 2.x
Here you will find everything related to the Aplazame plugin for Magento version 2 and later.

:::tip
  Keep nearby the **private API key** related to your online store, which you can obtain from your [control panel](https://vendors.aplazame.com/) in the **Preferencias** section.
:::

## Download and installation
:::info
  You must have `composer` in your **Magento 2.x** installation.
:::

In the directory of your store created in Magento 2.x enter the following commands in the console:
``` shell
$ composer require aplazame/magento2
  php bin/magento module:enable Aplazame_Payment
  php bin/magento setup:upgrade
  php bin/magento setup:di:compile
```

## Basic configuration
In the payment method configuration settings (**Stores > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods**) you must do the following:
- Include your **private API key**.
- Activate **Aplazame** as a payment method.
- If you want to do a test, activate **Test Mode (Sandbox)** and make a test purchase using our [test data](../../api/test-environment/test-data/).
:::caution
  Remember to deactivate **Test Mode (Sandbox)** when you finish the tests to leave the payment method in production mode and real orders can be carried out.
