# Plugin for previous versions of Magento
We have a plugin for **Magento versions 1.9.x**.

:::caution
  As it's a version of Magento that is no longer officially supported, the support we offer to the plugin for said version is limited.
:::
:::tip
  Keep nearby the **private API key** related to your online store, which you can obtain from your [control panel](https://vendors.aplazame.com/) in the **Preferencias** section.
:::

## Download
Download the plugin for 1.9.x versions of Magento from [this link](https://aplazame.com/static/sdk/magento-latest.tgz).

## Installation
- Access the administration panel of your store created in Magento 1.9.x.
- Navigate to the **System > Magento Connect > Magento Connect Manager** section.
- In the **Direct package file upload** section, select the downloaded file and click the **Upload** button.

## Basic configuration
In the payment method configuration settings (**System > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods**) you must do the following:
- Include your **private API key**.
- Activate **Aplazame** as a payment method.
- If you want to do a test, activate **Test Mode (Sandbox)** and make a test purchase using our [test data](../../api/test-environment/test-data/).
:::caution
  Remember to deactivate **Test Mode (Sandbox)** when you finish the tests to leave the payment method in production mode and real orders can be carried out.
