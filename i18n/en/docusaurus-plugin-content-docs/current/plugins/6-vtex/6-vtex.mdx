# VTEX integration
Here you will find everything you need to integrate Aplazame into your VTEX store.

:::tip
  Keep nearby the **public API key** related to your online store, which you can obtain from your [control panel](https://vendors.aplazame.com/) in the **Preferencias** section.
:::

## Configure the Aplazame payment method
- Access the administrator of your VTEX store, go to **Payments > Settings**.
- Select the **Affiliations** tab.
- Add the **Aplazame** connector with the affiliation name you want and with the following configuration:
```diff
Application Key: aplazame
Application Token: <here you must copy your public API key>
```
:::caution
  In the **Environment** section you can choose `Test` if you want to test the payment method first using our [test data](../../api/test-environment/test-data/), but don't forget change it to `Live/Production` once you are done with testing.
:::

- Select the **Payment Plans** tab.
- Add a new plan and category **Other** in which **Aplazame** will appear. We set it to **Active** status and link it to the previously created affiliation.
:::info
  Aplazame can take up to 10 minutes to appear at the checkout of your store as a payment option. You have more information in the [VTEX documentation](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurar-pago-con-aplazame--3v2uLgnOZ1dSE9AnhpDt3s).

## Widget for VTEX
We have an [app to display our widget in VTEX store](https://github.com/aplazame/vtex-widget-app).

### Installation
- [Install](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-installing-an-app) the `aplazame.aplazame-widget` app in the VTEX account which you are working on.
- Add it as peer dependency in the `manifest.json` of your store theme.
```diff
"peerDependencies": {
+ "aplazame.aplazame-widget": "0.x"
}
```
- In your VTEX account's admin, open the **App** section and select the **Aplazame Widget** app configuration.
- Fill in your **public API key** and save your changes.

### Adding widget to your store products
Add the `aplazame-product-widget` block in your store product template (for example: `~/store/blocks/product.jsonc` at `flex-layout.col`):
```diff
"flex-layout.col#right-col": {
  "props": { ... },
  "children": [
    ...
    "flex-layout.row#buy-button",
+   "aplazame-product-widget",
    "availability-subscriber",
    ...
  ]
}
```
