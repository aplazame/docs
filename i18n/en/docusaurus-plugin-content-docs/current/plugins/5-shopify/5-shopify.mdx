# App for Shopify
Here you will find everything related to the Aplazame app for Shopify.

:::tip
  Keep nearby the **private API key** related to your online store, which you can obtain from your [control panel](https://vendors.aplazame.com/) in the **Preferencias** section.
:::

## App linking
Add the Aplazame app from [Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/aplazame-public-app?locale=es).

## Configuration and activation
Once the app is linked to the store, you will be asked to include the **private API key**.
- Paste the **private API key** in the app settings and click the **Configurar** button.
:::info
  If the **private API key** is valid, the app will redirect to the section to activate the payment method.
:::
- Click on the **Activate Aplazame** button and you would already have Aplazame as a payment method in your Shopify store.
- If you want to do a test, activate **Enable test mode** and make a test purchase using our [test data](../../api/test-environment/test-data/).
:::caution
  Remember to deactivate **Enable test mode** when you finish the tests to leave the payment method in production mode and real orders can be carried out.
