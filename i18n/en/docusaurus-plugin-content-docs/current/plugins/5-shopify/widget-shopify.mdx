# Widget for Shopify
Here you will find everything related to the widget included in our Aplazame app for Shopify.

## Add the widget
Follow these steps to add the Aplazame widget to your Shopify store.
:::info
  You need an [Online Store 2.0](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/managing-themes/upgrading-themes) theme to add the widget.
  In case you don't have it, you must include the [widget code](../../../api/widget) adapting it to your template.
:::

First of all, log in to your Shopify shop administration panel, go to **Online Store > Themes** and click the **Customize** button for your current theme.
:::tip
  Keep nearby the **public API key** related to your online store, which you can obtain from your [control panel](https://vendors.aplazame.com/) in the **Preferencias** section.
:::

### Product widget
- Select the product template in the top dropdown or navigate to any product to access the template.
- Add our app's **Widget (Producto)** block or **Widget v4 (Producto)** block, depending on the style you want, and move it to where you want to display the widget.

### Cart widget
- Select the cart template in the top dropdown or navigate to the cart to access the template.
- Add our app's **Widget (Carrito)** block or **Widget v4 (Carrito)** block, depending on the style you want, and move it to where you want to display the widget.

:::caution
  Remember to configure each widget with your **public API key** and save the changes so that they are applied to your store.
:::
:::tip
  The style of the  **Widget v4** is editable from the plugin settings, but the style of the standard **Widget** is edited from the [control panel](https://vendors.aplazame.com/) in the section **Preferencias > Ajustes del widget**.
