# Pay in 4

## Integration
In case the merchant supports the product 'Pay in 4', you can add the parameter `data-pay-in-4 =' true'` to the [installment payment widget](./instalments-payment) . This will cause a change in the design of the widget, which will show the necessary information only for 'Pay in 4'.



|<t id="table.parameter">Parámetro</t> | <t id="table.type">Tipo</t> | <t id="table.required">Requerido</t> | <t id="table.description">Descripción</t>|
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|data-pay-in-4 | boolean | Yes | The attribute should be **true** or empty to work properly. This field causes a complete change in the rendering of the wdiget in case the merchant supports the product 'Pay in 4'. In case it does not support it or the total of the checkout does not meet the requirements for the product, it will behave exactly the same as the ['Payment in installments' widget](./instalments-payment)


:::caution
  If the widget has the attribute `data-pay-in-4` but the merchant does not support the product' Pay in 4' or the amount to finance (`data-amount`) is too high, the widget it will behave exactly like the [installment payment widget](./instalments-payment), as long as the merchant supports the 'Installment payment' product, inheriting all its attributes.
